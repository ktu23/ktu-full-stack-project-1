## Kevin Tu's Full Stack Project - Joke Factory
## Back End - Express/Server

## Explanation of the App

This is the back end of the CRUD Joke Factory app. 
The curl scripts in the auth and jokes section will link to the front end so that users can sign in, sign up,
change password, sign out, and create/destroy/index/show/update resources.

The routes are routers to the index/show/create/update paths.
The models are for the schema structure to take th e information required into the app.
